Iâ€™m currently a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at the [Jeong Lab](https://haewonjeong.com/) and the [REAL AI Lab](https://www.ai.ece.ucsb.edu/) at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/).
My research interests lie at the intersection of **Fair Machine Learning**, with a focus on **Generative AI**, and the application of **AI for Science and Social Good**. My work investigates biases in various AI models and explores strategies to mitigate them. Currently, my research is centered on **fair data imputation**â€”using generative models to address missing data and enhance fairness in the crucial pre-processing stage of the AI pipeline.

Prior to this, I obtained my BS in Computer Engineering from University of Tehran, Iran. While there, I worked on detecting hate speech in cross-lingual context in twitter posts using graph neural networks.
